# Contributing

Thanks for considering contributing to Renda!

There are many ways to contribute:

## Submitting Bug Reports

If you've found a problem with Renda Studio or its engine, you can search for
and report bugs [here](https://github.com/rendajs/Renda/issues). The more
details the better. If you've found an existing bug make sure to üëç it to
indicate that you're having the issue as well.

## Submitting Suggestions

If you have a suggestion, we'd love to hear about it! Try to describe what issue
you are trying to solve. Usually there are multiple ways to go about solving it.
Maybe others can chime in and share their thoughts on what a solution should
look like. Or maybe there is even already a solution available!

## Q&A

The GitHub issue tracker is meant for bugs and suggestions. If you have
questions (or answers!) you can post those on our
[GitHub Discussions page](https://github.com/rendajs/Renda/discussions/categories/q-a)
for Renda.

## Submitting Pull Requests

Renda is not accepting Pull Requests at the moment. Renda is still pretty early
in development and major decisions about the architecture are still being made.

Once we have a more clear view of what components are in a more finished state.
We'll be tagging issues with 'help wanted' to indicate the desire for pull
requests.

## Updating documentation

If you found incorrect information or a typo in this manual, you can let us know
by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/rendajs/manual/issues).

Or if you want to fix it yourself, you can all submit a pull request. You don't
need any programming knowledge to be able to do this. Just find the file you
want to edit [in this repository](https://github.com/rendajs/manual) and click
the edit button in the top right. More info about editing files on GitHub can be
found
[here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/editing-files).
