# Project Window

The project window contains all of the assets in your project. The assets are
shown in a regular folder structure, so you organize your files and folders to
your liking.

Using it is relatively straightforward. You can drag files and folders around to
organize them. It's also possible to drag assets to droppable GUIs in other
windows.

If you prefer not to drag, it's also possible to right-click an asset and then
choose **Copy Asset UUID**. Similarly, you can also right-click the destination
GUI and choose **Paste Asset UUID**.
