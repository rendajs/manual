# Project Window

The project window contains all of the assets in your project. The assets are
shown in a regular folder structure, so you organize your files and folders to
your likings.

Using it is relatively straight forward. You can drag files and folders around
to organise them. It's also possible to drag assets to droppable GUIs in other
windows.

If you prefer not to drag, it's also possible to right click an asset and then
choosing **Copy Asset UUID**, and then right clicking the destination GUI and
choosing **Paste Asset UUID**.
