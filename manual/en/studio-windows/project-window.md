# Project Window

The project window contains all of the assets in your project. It displays the
assets in a regular folder structure, so you can organize your files and folders
to your liking.

Using it is relatively straightforward. You can drag files and folders around to
organize them. It's also possible to drag assets to droppable GUIs in other
windows.

If you prefer not to drag, it's also possible to right-click an asset and then
choose **Copy Asset UUID**. Similarly, you can also right-click the destination
GUI and choose **Paste Asset UUID**.

To rename assets or folders, you can select them and either press `Enter` or
`F2`. It is also possible to rename them via the right-click context menu.
