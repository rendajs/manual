# Outliner

The outliner allows you to modify the hierarchy of your current entity editor.
In here you can create or delete entities, drag entities around, or rename them.

To create a new entity, click the **+** button at the top of the content window.

To delete an entity and all of its children, right click an entity and click
**Delete** or use the `Delete` key.

To rename an entity, press `Enter` or `F2`.

## Working With Multiple Entity Editors

If you have multiple [entity editors](./entity-editor.md) open. The outliner
isn't able to know which hierarchy you'd like it to display. When this is the
case an extra drop down menu appears. From this menu you can select which entity
editor you'd like to link up with the outliner.
