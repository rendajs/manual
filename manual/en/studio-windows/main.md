# Studio Windows

Renda Studio is divided into several windows. Each window has an icon in the top
left corner. And you can recognize what type of window something by its icon.

NOTE: If the icon seems a bit mysterious to you, you can also hover over it with
your mouse and get a tooltip that tells you the name of the window type.

You may have noticed that some windows have several of these icons. That's
because these are, in fact, also tabs! You can drag these tabs around the screen
and organize your windows that way.

To close or open new tabs, you can right-click those buttons to open a context
menu. Clicking **Close Tab** will close the tab that you right-clicked. **Add
Tab** on the other hand will show you a list of all the tab types that can be
added. Naturally, you can also resize windows by dragging their edges around.

This way you can customize your workspace to your own preferences.

## Windows and Content Windows

Because each window can have multiple tabs in it, Renda has two distinguished
concepts for windows:

- **Windows** are the full areas you see on the screen, they are the ones that
  you can resize.
- **Content windows** are the individual tabs and their content.

We'll use 'content window' and 'tab' interchangeably throughout this manual.
