# Introduction

Renda is a modern rendering engine built with the web in mind. You can use it to create games, interactive experiences,
or anything that requires 3d graphics. It is lightweight, has zero dependencies, and its download size scales with the
number of features you use.

## Choose Your Approach

If you're just starting out with development, you likely want to use Renda Studio. It is an editor which easily allows
you to build your scenes, materials, and assets. If you want to learn how to use Renda Studio, head over to
[Getting Started](./getting-started/main.md).

But if you prefer to use Renda as a library this is possible as well. Head over to
[Framework, Library, or in Between](./framework-library-or-in-between.md) to find out how.
