# Introduction

Renda is a modern rendering engine built with the web in mind. You can use it to
create games, interactive experiences, or anything that requires 3d graphics. It
is lightweight, has zero dependencies, and its download size scales with how
many features you use.

Renda comes with an online editor called [Renda Studio](https://renda.studio)
where you can easily build your scenes and adjust parameters to your liking.

## Choose Your Approach

If you're just starting out with development, you likely want to use Renda
Studio. It is an editor which allows you to easily build your scenes, or adjust
materials and other assets. If you want to learn how to use Renda Studio, head
over to [Getting Started](./getting-started/).

But if you'd rather prefer to control your application from a code editor, it is
also possible to use Renda as a library. Head over to
[Framework, Library, or in Between](./getting-started/framework-library-or-in-between.md)
to find out how.
