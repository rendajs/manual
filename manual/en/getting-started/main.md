# Getting Started

This section goes over how to use Renda Studio. If you'd like to use Renda as a
library instead, you can find out more about this at
[Framework, Library, or in Between](./framework-library-or-in-between.md).

## Installation

Installation of Renda Studio is as easy as going to
[renda.studio](https://renda.studio/) in your browser. While Studio may be
hosted as a website, don't be fooled by its platform! Your projects are stored
entirely on your own device.

NOTE: Renda is still in early development, so for now, only Canary versions are
available. In the future, you'll be able to specify what version you want in the
url. But for now, you'll be able to pin your version to a specific git commit
using `https://commit-{hash}.renda.studio`. For example,
https://commit-227389af7d3b3d335f14c17c7d4c787fed152e35.renda.studio/ will take
you to a very old version of Renda Studio.

If you like to run Renda Studio locally, you can also check out the source and
[build Renda Studio](../contributing/building-from-source.md) yourself.
