# Getting Started

This section goes over how to use Renda Studio. If you'd like to use Renda as a
library instead, you can find out more about this at
[Framework, Library, or in Between](../framework-library-or-in-between.md).

## Installation

Installation of Renda Studio is as easy as going to
[renda.studio](https://renda.studio/) in your browser. Renda is still in early
development, so for now, only Canary versions are available. In the future,
you'll be able to visit specific URLs if you want a specific version of Studio.
But for now, you'll be able to pin your version to a specific git commit using
`https://commit-{hash}.renda.studio`. For example,
https://commit-227389af7d3b3d335f14c17c7d4c787fed152e35.renda.studio/ will take
you to a very old version of Renda Studio.

You can also check out the source and
[build Renda Studio](../contributing/building-from-source.md) yourself.
