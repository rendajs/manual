# Workspaces

You may remember the context menu for managing window tabs from earlier. Let's go over what the **Workspaces** option in
this context menu does. Perhaps unsurprisingly, this menu allows you to manage your workspaces. A workspace contains the
entire configuration of your windows: Their sizes, layout, and the tab types they contain.

NOTE: It is possible for workspaces to also store the preferences of some tabs. For instance, you might want to create a
workspace where no grid or gizmos are shown, while still keeping this visible in your default workspace.

## Creating New Workspaces

When you start Renda Studio it automatically creates a new workspace for you. So if you don't want to use workspaces you
don't have to. Studio will automatically load the layout from the last time.

There are two ways to create a new workspace, the easiest one is clicking **Add New Workspace**. This will create a new
workspace using the default Studio layout. Alternatively, you can clone one of your existing workspaces by choosing
**Clone** inside of the workspace that you wish to clone.

## Saving Workspaces

New workspaces have the **Autosave** toggle enabled by default. So you can make all the changes you like without having
to worry about losing your workspaces. But if you want to quickly try something out, you can uncheck this and make your
changes. If you want to revert to the way things were, click **Revert to Saved State**. Or you can click **Save** if you
like and store your new messy layout.

NOTE: Refreshing the page does not revert your workspace, even with autosave disabled. If you want to revert your
workspace you have to explicitly click the **Revert to Saved State** button.
