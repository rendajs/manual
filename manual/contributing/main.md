# Contributing

Thanks for considering contributing to Renda!

There are many ways to contribute:

- **Reporting bugs:** The more details the better. If you've found an existing bug make sure to üëç it to indicate that
  you're having the issue as well. If you've found a problem with Renda Studio or its engine, you can search for and
  report bugs [here](https://github.com/rendajs/Renda/issues).
- **Submitting Pull Requests:** Before submitting a pull request, make sure an issue exists for it first. You can
  discuss the implications of your change in the issue before working on it. That way you can avoid any surprising
  requests for a large number of changes.
- **Updating documentation:** You can also submit Pull Requests for changes to this manual. You don't need any
  programming knowledge to be able to do this. Just find the file you want to edit
  [in this repository](https://github.com/rendajs/manual) and click the edit button in the top right. More info about
  editing files on GitHub can be found
  [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/editing-files).
- **Spreading the word:** Share knowledge about Renda with the community or ask questions. Tell your friends about
  Renda, tell your mom, tell your local plumber!
