# Overview of Renda Studio

At this point you should have [renda.studio](https://renda.studio/) open in your browser. When you start Studio for the
first time, you will be greeted with its splash screen. You can dismiss it by either clicking the **New Project** button
or clicking outside of the splash screen.

NOTE: If you have already opened and edited a project before, by default this splash screen won't show up. You can click
the **Open Project** button inside the **Project Window** if you want to open it again. More about this later.

## Studio Windows

Renda Studio is devided in several windows. Each window has a button in the top left corner. And you can recognise what
type of window something is via the icon that is shown inside the button. If the icon seems a bit misterious to you, you
can also hover over the button with your mouse and get a tooltip that tells you the name of the window type. Every
window type has a separate function.

We'll go over what each window does later. But first let's take a closer look at those buttons. You may have noticed
that some windows have several buttons in the top left corner. That's because these are not just regular buttons, they
are, in fact, also tabs! You can drag these buttons around the screen and origanize your windows that way.

NOTE:

Because each window can have multiple tabs in it, Renda has two distinguished concepts for windows:

- **Windows** are the full areas you see on the screen, they are the ones that you can resize.
- **Content windows** are the sections that contain all of the ui for that tab type. They are basically the same area as
  the window but excluding the tab buttons.

So one window can contain multiple content windows, but only a single content window can be visible inside a window at a
time.

From here on out this manual will refer to windows and content windows as such.

END NOTE

To close or open new tabs you can right click those buttons to open a context menu. Clicking **Close Tab** will close
the tab that you right clicked. **Add Tab** on the other hand will show you a list of all the tab types that can be
added.
